## Introduction

A Chrome extension that saves you time on [kvizd.hr](https://kvizd.hr).

Instead of having to wait for useful links to show up (e.g. live score links), with this extension they are available immediately.

### Before

This is how the page looks before applying the extension; notice that it's loading (may take several seconds before the link you need appears).

### After

I would show you how it looks after applying the extension, but the styling (CSS) is really not nice. But I promise it's an improvement in the practical sense.

## Install

Currently you have to install this extension from source. Follow these steps:

1. Either clone this repo or download its [zip archive](https://github.com/FabijanC/wiki-relevance/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unpack it
2. Go to your extension manager (or paste `chrome://extensions/` into your address bar)
3. Press **Load unpacked** and select the extension directory
